brief: This brief asked us to create a <em>“new customer experience to help the
  BBC’s audience fit the BBC into their daily lives, tailored and optimised to
  where they are and the device they are using”.</em> This meant thinking deeply
  about the scenarios in which users access BBC services, how they do so, and
  how can we expand that experience in a unique, exciting way.
solution: Our solution, <em>BBC Evoke,</em> uses the users immediate experience —via
  real-time video and sound— to curate  unique collections of content that are
  perfectly suited to their environment. Our concept would use object
  recognition technology to recognise the users' environment and select BBC
  content that relates specifically to those observations.
