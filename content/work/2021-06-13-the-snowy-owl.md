![“One can make a strong case that snowy owls are among the handful of species, along with walruses, polar bears, and ivory gulls, at most immediate and direct risk from climate change.”  — Scott Weidensaul, A World On The Wing](the-snowy-owl-slides.001.jpg)

![The story of the snowy owl is directly entwined with that of the Arctic. This project focuses in on that fact by centering the experience around a map. Specifically upon a gnomonic projection: a view of the earth looking directly down upon the north pole. This view shows the entirety of the Snowy Owls regular range, from Scandinavia to northern Canada and across to Greenland.](the-snowy-owl-slides.003.jpg)

![The Snowy Owl invites the user to interact with an eye-catching map, a physical disc is moved across the map onto highlighted areas, a satisfying magnetic pull attaches the object to the location and the interface changes accordingly ](the-snowy-owl-slides.004.jpg)

![As the disc is placed upon specific areas of the map the interface responds accordingly. Visualisations appear that relate to the snowy owl and that location; stories ranging from their declining population, to the vast distances which they migrate. These stories all add up to become chapters in a non-linear story, each individual story making up part of a greater whole.](the-snowy-owl-slides.005.jpg)

![Designed to be explored primarily in situ, within a museum, or alongside the animal in a zoo or sanctuary. The physical map, the main mode of interaction exists in front of a digital display, inviting curious visitors to interact and explore the experience.](the-snowy-owl-slides.006.jpg)

![Although designed to be used with the physical map as the main mode of interaction, The Snowy Owl is still a web-app and can be interacted with on any device. The map is replicated on screen and can be interacted with directly, each point is clickable and acts to achieve the same result as its associated position on the physical map.](the-snowy-owl-slides.007.jpg)

![The Snowy Owl is built using Gatsby.js; chosen for the elegant routing possible with React based web apps and the benefits of the static output generated by Gatsby. The static nature of Gatsby ensures each page is indexable by search engines, and importantly will generated rich previews when shared on social media.  CSS is handled using the CSS-in-JS package Styled Components, with layout and response design handled using the Bootstrap grid system.](the-snowy-owl-slides.008.jpg)

![This experience is open to all, regardless of whether they are able to visit the physical space. As such the web experience had to adapt to the users device. This meant responsive design was essential. Here I’ve used Bootstraps grid system to ensure that content is always laid out in a way that is accessible and effective.](the-snowy-owl-slides.009.jpg)
