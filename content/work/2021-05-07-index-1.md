  An app and experience that builds upon the most fundamental of shared human
  experiences: storytelling.


  </br>


  Folktiles is built using <b>Next.js</b>, with <b>Tensorflow.js</b> to analyse sentiment in user-submitted stories, <b>D3.js</b> to create visual representations of this data, and finally, <b>MongoDB</b> to save and share these stories with the world.

brief: >-
  <em> "The coronavirus pandemic is the backdrop to the foreseeable future for
  society, culture and business where ​everything​ needs to be redesigned for
  the better. The pandemic ​is​ an opportunity to design everything for the
  better. What are the opportunities? What is better? Who is it for?"</em>


  </br>


  The goal of this project was to respond to 'The New Normal'. To create something that responds to how society, culture and business have all been forced to change, and how we have all had to adapt the ways in which we interact on both an individual and a societal level.
