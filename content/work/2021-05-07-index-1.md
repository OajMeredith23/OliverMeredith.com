description: "Folktiles is an app and experience that builds upon the most
  fundamental of shared human experiences: storytelling. Folktiles is a
  **Next.js** app that uses **Tensorflow.js** to analyse sentiment in user
  inputted text, this emotional data is then used to create a data
  representation with **D3.js**, and finally, the story and its associated data
  representation are shared with the world via a database created using
  **MongoDB.**"

brief: >-2
   *"The coronavirus pandemic is the backdrop to the foreseeable future for society, culture and business where ​everything​ needs to be redesigned for the better. The pandemic ​is​ an opportunity to design everything for the better. What are the opportunities? What is better? Who is it for?"* 

  The goal of this project was to respond to 'The New Normal'. To create something that responds to how society, culture and business have all been forced to change and how we have all had to adapt the ways in which we interact on both an individual and a societal level.
