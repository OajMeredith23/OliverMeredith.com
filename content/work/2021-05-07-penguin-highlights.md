  set by Penguin: <em>"Heighten the reading experience with Penguin"</em>'

brief: The brief for this project was to design a product that enhances the
  experience the audience has with their books. It wasn't necessarily about
  encouraging people to read more, but to make the experience of reading even
  better.
solution: My solution was to engage people in the thoughtful sharing of their
  experience through the highlighting and sharing of specific passages. Users
  can share their own insights with others, or keep them to themselves. And by
  engaging with others highlights books can be recommended by feeding off the
  interests of those other users that they find engaging.
